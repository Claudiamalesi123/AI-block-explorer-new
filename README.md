# AI-Assisted Block Explorer

## Overview

The **AI-Assisted Block Explorer** is a Streamlit application designed to provide a natural language interface for exploring blockchain transaction data. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the app enables users to query blockchain transactions using human-readable queries. The backend is powered by the Transformers library from Hugging Face, and mock transaction data is simulated via the `explorer.py` module.

## Features

- **Natural Language Querying:** Users can enter queries like "How many transactions were made for wallet123 on 2024-07-21?" and receive contextually relevant answers.
- **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to make querying and data exploration seamless.
- **Custom Styling:** Enhanced user experience through custom CSS styling applied via Streamlit‚Äôs Markdown support.

## Libraries

The app utilizes the following Python libraries:

- **Transformers**: For question-answering capabilities using pre-trained NLP models.
- **Torch**: As a core dependency for the Transformers library.
- **Torchvision**: Used for any vision-related tasks if required in future extensions.
- **Torchaudio**: For audio processing tasks, should they be required.
- **Streamlit**: To create the interactive web application.
- **Requests**: For handling HTTP requests, though it‚Äôs primarily used here for mock data fetching.

These libraries are specified in the `requirements.txt` file and need to be installed to run the app.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Claudiamalesi123/AI-block-explorer-new.git
   cd AI-block-explorer-new
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser to interact with the application.

This file contains the main logic for the Streamlit application:

```python

### `explorer.py`

This file contains the mock data fetching logic:

```python
import requests

def get_transactions(wallet, date):
    # Expanded mock response to simulate real API data
    transactions = {
        "wallet": wallet,
        "date": date,
        "transactions": [
            {"id": "tx1", "amount": 50, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T14:48:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx2", "amount": 100, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T15:00:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx3", "amount": 150, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T16:30:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx4", "amount": 200, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T17:00:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx5", "amount": 250, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T18:00:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx6", "amount": 300, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T19:00:00.000Z"}
        ]
    }
    return transactions
```

### `requirements.txt`

Specifies the necessary Python libraries:

```
transformers
torch
torchvision
torchaudio
streamlit
requests
```

## GCP Requirements

Currently, the application runs locally and does not directly utilize Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. However, if you plan to deploy this application to GCP, you will need to ensure:

- **Google Cloud Storage**: For storing any large datasets or models.
- **App Engine** or **Compute Engine**: For hosting the Streamlit app.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine**: If deploying at scale using Kubernetes.
- **Google Cloud Functions**: If any serverless functions are needed for processing.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with pushing to GitHub, ensure the following:

- The correct repository URL is used.
- You have appropriate access rights to the repository.
- The `.gitignore` file is configured correctly to exclude unnecessary files and directories.

For further assistance, consult the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/) or [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/).
