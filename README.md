# AI-assisted Block Explorer

The AI-assisted Block Explorer is a Streamlit app that allows users to interact with blockchain transaction data using natural language queries. The app leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide insightful responses to user queries about blockchain transactions.

**Live App:** [AI-assisted Block Explorer](https://ai-block-explorer-claudiamalesi.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

The app is designed to provide an intuitive and interactive interface for exploring blockchain transactions. It allows users to input natural language queries related to blockchain data and get relevant answers based on the provided mock data.

## Features

- **Natural Language Querying:** Users can ask questions about blockchain transactions using natural language.
- **Data Extraction:** The app extracts relevant wallet and date information from the user's query.
- **Contextual Answers:** The app uses a question-answering model to provide contextually accurate responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app includes custom styling to enhance the user experience.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: Main file for the Streamlit application. It handles user input, processes queries, and displays results.
- `explorer.py`: Contains a mock implementation of the function to fetch blockchain transactions.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required for the app.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Installation

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Claudiamalesi123/AI-block-explorer-new.git
    cd AI-block-explorer-new
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash

## Code Explanation

### `app.py`

The main file for the Streamlit application. It handles user input, processes queries, and displays results.

```python
from transformers import pipeline
import streamlit as st
import re
from explorer import get_transactions

# Initialize the pipeline
nlp = pipeline("question-answering")

# Streamlit app
st.set_page_config(page_title="AI-assisted Block Explorer", page_icon="üîç")

def main():
    st.title("üîç AI-assisted Block Explorer")
    st.write("Enter a natural language query to explore blockchain data.")

        st.write("5. What is the highest transaction amount for wallet789?")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### `explorer.py`

Contains a mock implementation of the function to fetch blockchain transactions.

```python
import requests

def get_transactions(wallet, date):
    # Expanded mock response to simulate real API data
    transactions = {
        "wallet": wallet,
        "date": date,
        "transactions": [
            {"id": "tx1", "amount": 50, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T14:48:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx2", "amount": 100, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T15:00:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx3", "amount": 150, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T16:30:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx4", "amount": 200, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T17:00:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx5", "amount": 250, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T18:00:00.000Z"},
            {"id": "tx6", "amount": 300, "timestamp": "2024-07-21T19:00:00.000Z"}
        ]
    }
    return transactions
```

### `requirements.txt`

Lists the Python packages required for the app.

```
transformers
torch
torchvision
torchaudio
streamlit
requests
```

## Libraries Used

- **Transformers**: For natural language processing using the `pipeline` API.
